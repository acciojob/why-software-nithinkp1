	 <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and creating things that can have a real impact on people's lives. Technology is shaping the future, and being a developer gives me the power to build tools, applications, and systems that can help individuals and businesses operate more efficiently. I'm also excited by the fact that learning never stops in this fieldâ€”there's always something new to explore, whether it's a programming language, a framework, or an innovative way of thinking. The mix of creativity, logic, and continuous learning makes software development the perfect career path for me.
